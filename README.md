# Portfolio Repository

This repository serves to compile some of the programming projects I've made, either for class or for extracurricular projects.

## IRISHSAT Helmholtz Cage Driver

Built in collaboration with IRISHSAT GOAT Electrical Lab, the project is built with C++ and Python to control a Helmholtz cage. Incorporates communication between Arduino Nano IoT, Arduino Uno R4, and Raspberry Pi5. Utilizes PWM to control magnetic field within cage and PID to set PWM values as desired.

Meant to run PySol simulated magnetic field values (imported via `.csv` file) and export a `.csv` file which contains PWM values that correspond to each magnetic field in PySol. This `.csv` file is then used to run the simulation for magnetorquer testing.

## US Energy Consumption Map

Built for CSE20133 course in collaboration with 3 classmates, written in C++. The program loads a dataset into memory containing energy usage by US county, processes it to generate per capita data, and allows the user to choose between a set of plots which display the data on a 3D scatterplot.

The plots illustrate the data in map form, so users are able to understand which counties in the country utilize the most data and where they are located. Some interesting trends arise when comparing data between per-capita and total energy used.

## Arduino Timer/Clock Embedded System

Built for EE10200 course, written in C++. This project is a multifunctional display. This display is capable of showing the user the room temperature, a timer, and a stopwatch, all running simultaneously. The user is able to control the LCDâ€™s brightness, is able to start, stop, and reset the stopwatch, and is able to start, set a time, pause and change the time, and stop the timer. The user is notified by the end of the timer with an alarm, which can be turned off with a button.

## Latin America Country Data/Game

Built for EG10118 course, written in MATLAB. The project utilizes data collected from Latin American countries and constructs a set of visualizations from them. Users are allowed to select from data to compare, and can either compare one or two countries against each other. The purpose is to find trends within the data, especially when they affected countries and to measure the imapct of these trends.
Users can also play a game where they are asked to guess a country based on their outline on the map.
